# AggroEats
My girlfriend has a green anole named lizard named Aggro, and this is a web app game about it eating crickets. This is the purely front end implementation, check out this repo for a version implemented with a leaderboard! https://github.com/HectorRamosJunior/PersonalWebsite/tree/master/AggroEats

Goal of the game is to react to where the cricket is and click it before time runs out! Be quick, now!
